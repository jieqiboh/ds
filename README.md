### Basic DS implementations for my toy OS :P
#### Linked List
This is a general linked list implementation. Nodes can store data of any type using void pointers.
It contains basic functions to:
- init a new linked list
- insert data at the head
- delete a node
- delete an entire linked list
`malloc` should be changed to `kalloc` when using it in OS dev.

linked list + hashmap
basic tests + memory leak free
